\section{Introduction} 

% (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}  The task is to compute the coordinates of receiver ROV at given time using P1-code  and L1 phase observations from two GPS receivers: REF and ROV. The receiver REF has known coordinates. The calculations were done with observation files and other values given in the Excel document \emph{DiffAssignmentL1.xls}. Unlike the last lab, where the satellite and receiver clocks were not synchronized, this lab synchronizes clocks of all the satellites to the system time.
